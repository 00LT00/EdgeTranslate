## Side translation considerations

* __After installing or updating the extension, you must refresh the pages that needs to be translated, and then the translation functions can be available;__

* __Selection word translation method 2 needs to enable `Enable Select Translate` in the options, default enabled;__

* __Selection translation method 2 implementation in the pdf file depends on the built-in pdf file reader of this extension, so you must enable `Use Built-in PDF Viewer` in the options of this extension, default enabled;__

* __To translate the contents of the pdf file, you need to allow the application to access the file link in the options. The method is as shown in Figure 1; if you open the file access permission for the first time, you need to refresh the page to use the extension;__
